There are several ways to select a specific range of dates:
manually calculate the date and use this date in the filter to get the range. For this question, the result is looking for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27, which is all the days between 2019-06-28 and 2019-07-27:
activity_date > '2019-06-27' AND activity_date <= '2019-07-27'
or using BETWEEN:
activity_day BETWEEN '2019-06-28' AND '2019-07-27'
The date '2019-06-28' is used here because the BETWEEN operator is inclusive, and the begin and end values are included.
DATEDIFF(date1, date2): this function returns date1 - date2 expressed as a value in days from one date to the other, so there is no need to calculate the exact date for the filter:
DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date)<30 
AND 
DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date)>=0
the first condition checks that date2 is within 30 days of date1. The second condition checks that date2 does not occur after date1. Without the second condition, a negative difference is also '<30', and we will get dates after 2019-07-27 in this case
Another way to use DATEDIFF:
DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) BETWEEN 0 AND 29
DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL expr unit): this function performs date arithmetic, if the syntax does not support adding or subtracting days directly using operators such as '+' or '-':
activity_date BETWEEN date_sub('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) 
AND '2019-07-27'
